# leaflet-challenge
Module 15 Challenge: In this challenge, the task is developing a way to visualize USGS data that will allow USGS to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.

File - index.htlm contains the html code required to display the leaflet map and the USGS data

File - logic.js contains the Java Script file that pulls in the USGS data and sets up the display format. 

File - style.css contains the style file for the html 

In order to see the visualized data, you need to open a server and run the HTML file
